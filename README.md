Week 3 Day 3 - Project: Presentation of cinema data (movies and frequentation).

The aim of this project is to prepare a PowerPoint presentation for the Gaumont cinema company.  

## Data analysis
The file analysed shows data on the frequentation and movies in french cinemas from as early as 1938, up to 2021.

For this project, I restricted the data to years 1980 to 2021. The analysis was done using a mix of Excel and Tableau.

Additionally, I took into account the [closing dates of cinemas](https://ecran-total.fr/2021/08/02/quand-les-cinems-ont-ils-ete-fermes-en-2020-et-2021/) due to **Covid-19 pandemic** in 2020 and 2021:  
- From 14th March (week 11) to 21st of June 2020 (week 25) => around **6 months**
- From 30th of October 2020 (week 44) to 19th of May 2021 (week 20) => around **5 months** 

Also, I included information about **on-demand video** platforms (Netflix, Amazon Prime and Disney +):
- [Statista article](https://fr.statista.com/infographie/24389/evolution-nombre-abonnes-payants-svod-plateformes-streaming-video-netflix-prime-video-disney-/) 
- [BFM TV article](https://www.bfmtv.com/economie/consommation/streaming-video-8-3-millions-d-utilisateurs-quotidiens-en-france-un-budget-de-15-euros-par-mois_AN-202103090186.html)

It would be interesting the include these informations to the data analysis, but this was not done by lack of time.

## PowerPoint presentation
The presentation is done in English and French, to answer the question:  
**"Are movie theaters in decline?"** ("Le cinéma est-il en perte de vitesse ?").
