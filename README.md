For this project, we will restrict the data to years starting from 1980 to 2021.  
Additionally, we took into account the [closing dates of cinemas](https://ecran-total.fr/2021/08/02/quand-les-cinems-ont-ils-ete-fermes-en-2020-et-2021/) due to Covid-19 pandemic in 2020 and 2021:  
- From 14th March (week 11) to 21st of June 2020 (week 25)
- From 30th of October 2020 (week 44) to 19th of May 2021 (week 20)
